<h1>PAC Game Development Installation Guide</h1>
<p>
This guide should help you get Dr Java set up for developing these games.
</p>
<div class="captioned">
<img src="../imgs/original_pong.png" />
This is what the original Pong looked like. (From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Wikipedia</a>)
</div>


<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
Open up Dr. Java and let's get started. The code to start up an empty game is
below. We'll be using a <a href="../docs/index.html">whole bunch of libraries</a>
 which you should just go ahead and import.
Notice that our class <code>extends BounceGameWindow</code> 
(which means that the class is a BounceGameWindow) and then try
to figure out what our main method is doing. The code <code>new Pong()</code>
creates a new window, then the method <code>.start();</code> opens that window
on the screen. 
</p>
<pre><code class="java">import org.pac.games.*;
import org.pac.games.physics.*;
import org.pac.games.gui.*;
public class Pong extends BounceGameWindow{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    new Pong().start();
  }
}</code></pre>
<div class="captioned">
<img src="../imgs/pong01.png" />
An empty window.
</div>

<h2>Adding a Ball</h2>
<p>
Lets start off by adding a ball and stuff. We'll create a <em>constructor</em>
for our Pong window which sets up and adds a ball <em>sprite</em>.
A constructor is a method that gets called whenever you
create a new instance of a class (like when we called <code>new Pong()</code>).
A constructor is defined like any other method but without a return type and it
has to be the same name as the class. 
A sprite is a type of object which can move around and gets drawn on the screen.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">import org.pac.games.*;
import org.pac.games.physics.*;
import org.pac.games.gui.*;
public class Pong extends BounceGameWindow{
  BouncerSprite ball;
  public Pong(){
    MovingRectangle ballBounds = new MovingRectangle(315,235,10,10);
    ball = new BouncerSprite(ballBounds);
    addSprite(ball);
  }
  public static void main(String[] args){
    new Pong().start();
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>
So to go over what that new code does:
<ul>
  <li>We create a <code>BouncerSprite</code> variable called <code>ball</code> in the
    class (so that we can access it in other methods).</li>
  <li>We define a constructor which:
    <ul>
      <li>Sets up <code>ballBounds</code> which is a <code>MovingRectangle</code> in the 
        middle of the screen (315, 235) with a width of 10 and a height of 10.</li>
      <li>Creates <code>ball</code> with those bounds.</li>
      <li>Adds the ball to the screen.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<div class="captioned">
<img src="../imgs/pong02.png" />
Just a little ball in the middle.
</div>

<h2>Making the Ball Bounce</h2>
<p>
Lucky for you, we're working with a pre-made physics engine. So we don't actually have
to code bouncing mechanics manually. We'll just tell the ball to move and put a border
around the screen.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">  public Pong(){
    MovingRectangle ballBounds = new MovingRectangle(315,235,10,10);
    ball = new BouncerSprite(ballBounds);
    //make the ball move:
    ball.setDX(75); //75 pixels per second right
    ball.setDY(50); //50 pixels per second down
    addSprite(ball);
    //add a border around the entire screen
    addBounceBorder(0,0,640,480);
  }</code></pre>

<h2>Adding The Paddles</h2>
<p>
Lets define a class for paddles - not because we <em>need</em> to but because its just good
practice. Take a look at the code below. We'll add 2 variables, <code>leftPaddle</code>
and <code>rightPaddle</code>, to the <code>Pong</code> class. Then we'll set them up
in the constructor. We can use the new class we'll define at the bottom of the file.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">import org.pac.games.*;
import org.pac.games.physics.*;
import org.pac.games.gui.*;
public class Pong extends BounceGameWindow{
  BouncerSprite ball, leftPaddle, rightPaddle;
  public Pong(){
    //setup the ball
    MovingRectangle ballBounds = new MovingRectangle(315,235,10,10);
    ball = new BouncerSprite(ballBounds);
    //make the ball move:
    ball.setDX(75); //75 pixels per second right
    ball.setDY(50); //50 pixels per second down
    addSprite(ball);
    
    //setup the paddles
    leftPaddle = new Paddle(30, 200);
    rightPaddle = new Paddle(600, 200);
    addSprite(leftPaddle);
    addSprite(rightPaddle);
    
    //add a border around the entire screen
    addBounceBorder(0,0,640,480);
  }
  public static void main(String[] args){
    new Pong().start();
  }
}
class Paddle extends BouncerSprite{
  public Paddle(double x, double y){
    //Setup this BouncerSprite at (x,y) with a width of 10, a height
    //of 80. And one that will DO_NOTHING on an X collision and will
    //STOP on a Y collision.
    super(new MovingRectangle(x,y,10,80),
          Bouncer.DO_NOTHING,Bouncer.STOP);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>Paddle</code> class <code>extends BouncerSprite</code> just like the 
<code>Pong</code> class <code>extends BounceGameWindow</code>. That's why we can store
the paddles in <code>BouncerSprite</code> variables - because they're just special
types of <code>BouncerSprite</code>s.
</p>
<p>
The <code>super</code> keyword in the <code>Paddle</code> constructor is how you call
the constructor of the <em>parent class</em> (the class which the new class 
<code>extends</code>). In this case, the parent class is <code>BouncerSprite</code>.
You can see more about the <code>BouncerSprite</code> in the 
<a href="../docs/org/pac/games/gui/BouncerSprite.html">documentation</a>.
</p>
<div class="captioned">
<img src="../imgs/pong03.png" />
Now with paddles.
</div>

<h2>Controlling the Paddles</h2>
<p>
Its not really a game unless the players get to do something, right?
So now we've got to get the paddles under control. Let's make the W and S keys
control the left paddle and the up and down keys control the right one.
We're going to use something called <em>method overriding</em> which is when
you write a method that takes the place of another method in the parent class.
We'll be overriding the <code>keyPressed</code> and <code>keyReleased</code>
methods in <code>BounceGameWindow</code> which get called whenever a key on the
keyboard is pressed or released. We'll also need to import <code>KeyEvent</code>.
To start off, let's just get those methods set up:
</p>
<pre><code class="java">import org.pac.games.*;
import org.pac.games.physics.*;
import org.pac.games.gui.*;
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;
public class Pong extends BounceGameWindow{
  BouncerSprite ball, leftPaddle, rightPaddle;
  public Pong(){
    //setup the ball
    MovingRectangle ballBounds = new MovingRectangle(315,235,10,10);
    ball = new BouncerSprite(ballBounds);
    //make the ball move:
    ball.setDX(75); //75 pixels per second right
    ball.setDY(50); //50 pixels per second down
    addSprite(ball);
    
    //setup the paddles
    leftPaddle = new Paddle(30, 200);
    rightPaddle = new Paddle(600, 200);
    addSprite(leftPaddle);
    addSprite(rightPaddle);
    
    //add a border around the entire screen
    addBounceBorder(0,0,640,480);
  }
  @Override
  public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e){
    System.out.println("A key was pressed.");
  }
  @Override
  public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e){
    System.out.println("A key was released.");
  }
  public static void main(String[] args){
    new Pong().start();
  }
}
class Paddle extends BouncerSprite{
  public Paddle(double x, double y){
    //Setup this BouncerSprite at (x,y) with a width of 10, a height
    //of 80. And one that will DO_NOTHING on an X collision and will
    //STOP on a Y collision.
    super(new MovingRectangle(x,y,10,80),
          Bouncer.DO_NOTHING,Bouncer.STOP);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>
That code should just print out some debug text whenever a key is pressed.
Notice the <code>@Override</code> that come before the new methods. That's not
100% necessary, but it's a good safeguard to put in if you're overriding a method.
It lets the compiler know what you're doing so it can check that you've spelled the
method name correctly.
</p>
<p>OK, so if you've got that working, lets move onto making the
paddles respond to they keys. You can check which key was pressed/released using
the <code>getKeyCode()</code> method which returns one of the values from the
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/KeyEvent.html">
<code>KeyEvent</code></a> class. And we'll use the same methods to set the speed
of the paddles as we used to set the speed of the ball.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">  @Override
  public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e){
    if(e.getKeyCode()==KeyEvent.VK_W){
      leftPaddle.setDY(-500); //make the left paddle start moving up
    }
    else if(e.getKeyCode()==KeyEvent.VK_S){
      leftPaddle.setDY(500); //make the left paddle start moving down
    }
    if(e.getKeyCode()==KeyEvent.VK_UP){
      rightPaddle.setDY(-500); //make the right paddle start moving up
    }
    else if(e.getKeyCode()==KeyEvent.VK_DOWN){
      rightPaddle.setDY(500); //make the right paddle start moving down
    }
  }
  @Override
  public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e){
    if(e.getKeyCode()==KeyEvent.VK_W || e.getKeyCode()==KeyEvent.VK_S){
      leftPaddle.setDY(0); //stop the left paddle
    }
    else if(e.getKeyCode()==KeyEvent.VK_UP || e.getKeyCode()==KeyEvent.VK_DOWN){
      rightPaddle.setDY(0); //stop the right paddle
    }
  }</code></pre>
<div class="captioned">
<img src="../imgs/pong04.png" />
It's actually starting to look like a video game.
</div>

<h2>Keeping Score</h2>
<p>
We've got some moving parts, so now its time to start keeping score. 
That actually involves several different steps, if you think about it. 
We've got to:
<ul>
  <li>recognize when one of the players has scored;</li>
  <li>keep track of the score (because otherwise, what's the point);</li>
  <li>and draw the score on the screen so the players can see how they're doing.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
So how do we get started on all that? We could skim 
<a href="../docs/org/pac/games/BounceGameWindow.html">the docs</a> for some
other methods to override or call, that's usually a pretty good place to start.
You might see the 
<a href="../docs/org/pac/games/BounceGameWindow.html#handleCollision(org.pac.games.physics.CollisionInstance)">
<code>handleCollision</code></a> method, that's a method to override that
looks like it could help with recognizing when the player has scored.
And there's a <a href="../docs/org/pac/games/BounceGameWindow.html#paint(java.awt.Graphics)">
<code>paint</code></a> method: that'll help us draw the score to the screen.
</p>
<p>
Lets start with the first problem - recognizing when the player has scored.
We've guessed that we'll want to used the <code>handleCollision</code> method
somehow. According to the docs, this method gets called whenever the physics engine
"detects a collision". We could start off by just implementing the method with
a print statement: 
</p>
<pre><code class="java">  @Override
  public void handleCollision(CollisionInstance e){
    System.out.println("handleCollision called");
  }</code></pre>
<p>
That should give us a better idea how the method works. Now we run the code
and we see that, yeah, this method does get called when the ball hits stuff.
But also when the paddles hit the top or bottom, and a couple of times when
the program first starts for some reason. We can learn more by looking at the
<a href="../docs/org/pac/games/physics/CollisionInstance.html"><code>CollisionInstance</code></a>
class since one of those gets passed to us when the method is called.
</p>
<p>
OK, so maybe that doesn't make it glaringly obvious what we should do. That
happens sometimes. It would take a whole bunch more digging to figure out what
to do, so I'm just going to tell you. If you came across a problem like this in
real life, this would be a good time to Google, then if that didn't work, just
ask someone more experienced for help.
</p>
<p>
We can use the <code>contains</code> method with <code>ball</code> because
<code>ball</code> is a <code>BouncerSprite</code> which is also a <code>Bouncer</code>.
So we can do something like this:
<pre><code class="java">  @Override
  public void handleCollision(CollisionInstance e){
    if(e.contains(ball)){
      System.out.println("handleCollision called containing ball");
    }
  }</code></pre>
<p>
That'll limit our print statement to only collisions involving the ball.
And that's halfway there. Now we just need to do something to recognize
only the collisions with the left and right wall. 
</p>
<pre><code class="java">  @Override
  public void handleCollision(CollisionInstance e){
    if(e.contains(ball) &amp;&amp; ball.leftX()&lt;1){
      System.out.println("right scored");
    }
    else if(e.contains(ball) &amp;&amp; ball.rightX()&gt;639){
      System.out.println("left scored");
    }
  }</code></pre>
<p>
That solves that problem. The next one is way easier - keeping track of the
score. We'll just define two new class variables, <code>leftScore</code> and
<code>rightScore</code>, and then we'll increment them instead of having
print statements:
</p>
<pre><code class="java">public class Pong extends BounceGameWindow{
  BouncerSprite ball, leftPaddle, rightPaddle;
  int leftScore, rightScore;
  ...
  @Override
  public void handleCollision(CollisionInstance e){
    if(e.contains(ball) &amp;&amp; ball.leftX()&lt;1){
      rightScore++;
    }
    else if(e.contains(ball) &amp;&amp; ball.rightX()&gt;639){
      leftScore++;
    }
  }
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>
That's old stuff. Drawing those scores to the screen is something new. Like
we guessed from the docs, we'll need to use the <code>paint</code> method
which gets passed a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html">
<code>Graphics</code></a> object. That means we're going to need to <code>import</code>
<code>java.awt.*</code> which the docs will tell you. 
</p>
<p>
That's a standard java class, so it's huge. But we only need to call a few of it's method,
which are all pretty simple. We'll set the color for our scoreboard to black,
set the font to a bold courier at 25pt, then draw the scores on the top of the screen.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">...
import java.awt.*;
public class Pong extends BounceGameWindow{
  ...
  @Override
  public void paint(Graphics g){
    //draw the scores
    g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
    g.setFont(new Font("Courier", Font.BOLD, 25));
    g.drawString(Integer.toString(leftScore), 80, 25);
    g.drawString(Integer.toString(rightScore), 540, 25);
  }
  ...</code></pre>
<div class="captioned">
<img src="../imgs/pong05.png" />
Now keeping score.
</div>

<h2>Resetting the Ball</h2>
<p>
It would be nice if the ball went back to the center of the screen after a point
was scored. We could just remove the old ball from the game entirely then add a new ball
entirely. Or, we might do some more digging through the docs and we might find
the method <a href="../docs/org/pac/games/BounceGameWindow.html#teleport(org.pac.games.physics.Bouncer, org.pac.games.physics.MovingRectangle)">
<code>teleport</code></a> which moves the ball <em>within the physics engine</em>.
So we'll create a <code>resetBall</code> method and call it in the <code>handleCollision</code> method.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">  ...
  public void resetBall(){
    teleport(ball, new MovingRectangle(315,235,10,10));
    //make the ball move:
    ball.setDX(75); //75 pixels per second right
    ball.setDY(50); //50 pixels per second down
  }
  @Override
  public void handleCollision(CollisionInstance e){
    if(e.contains(ball) &amp;&amp; ball.leftX()&lt;1){
      rightScore++;
      resetBall();
    }
    else if(e.contains(ball) &amp;&amp; ball.rightX()&gt;639){
      leftScore++;
      resetBall();
    }
  }
  ...</code></pre>
<p>
You'll notice that we also need to reset the ball's speed in the <code>resetBall</code> method.
(The <code>teleport</code> method stops the ball if it's teleported to a non-moving <code>MovingRectangle</code>).
We're also going to make another change to the code. It's for design purposes, not for any functional reason.
In programming, we want to follow the principal of "Don't Repeat Yourself", or 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>. So we'll replace some duplicate
code in the <code>Pong</code> constructor:
</p>
<pre><code class="java">  public Pong(){
    //setup the ball
    ball = new BouncerSprite();
    addSprite(ball);
    resetBall();
    
    //setup the paddles
    leftPaddle = new Paddle(30, 200);
    rightPaddle = new Paddle(600, 200);
    addSprite(leftPaddle);
    addSprite(rightPaddle);
    
    //add a border around the entire screen
    addBounceBorder(0,0,640,480);
  }</code></pre>

<h2>Accelerating the Ball</h2>
<p>
That ball is going pretty slow. I think we want the ball to be slow in the
beginning, but as the game goes on, it should get faster. We're going to use
3 more methods from the docs:
<ul>
  <li>We'll override the <a href="../docs/org/pac/games/BounceGameWindow.html#update(double)">
    <code>update</code></a> method from <code>BounceGameWindow</code>.</li>
  <li>We'll use <code>ball</code>'s <a href="../docs/org/pac/games/physics/Bouncer.html#nondirectionalAccelerateX(double)">
    <code>nondirectionalAccelerateX</code></a> and</li>
  <li><a href="../docs/org/pac/games/physics/Bouncer.html#nondirectionalAccelerateY(double)">
    <code>nondirectionalAccelerateY</code></a> methods to make the ball go faster.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<pre><code class="java">  @Override
  public void update(double dt){
    ball.nondirectionalAccelerateX(dt*20);
    ball.nondirectionalAccelerateY(dt*20);
  }</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>update</code> method get's passed the <code>dt</code> parameter which is the number of seconds
which have passed since the last time the method got called. Since the <code>nondirectionalAccelerate_</code>
methods just accelerate the ball a fixed amount, we need to multiply the acceleration factor by the
change in time.
</p>

<h2>Randomizing the Ball's Start Direction</h2>
<p>
It's kind of boring that the ball always starts going exactly the same direction. We should fix that.
There's a method <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#random()">
<code>Math.random()</code></a> that returns a random number between 0 and 1. We can use this to
do pretty much anything random we want. First of all, when we reset the ball, it should go either
left or right and either up or down:
</p>
<pre><code class="java">  public void resetBall(){
    teleport(ball, new MovingRectangle(315,235,10,10));
    //make the ball move:
    if(Math.random()&lt;0.5){
      ball.setDX(75); //75 pixels per second right
    }
    else{
      ball.setDX(-75); //75 pixels per second left
    }
    if(Math.random()&lt;0.5){
      ball.setDY(50); //50 pixels per second down
    }
    else{
      ball.setDY(-50); //50  pixels per second up
    }
  }</code></pre>
<p>
Notice that the if statements basically just mean "with a 50% chance".
</p>

<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>
<p>
There are a couple more finishing touches that'll be nice to have. We should put
a title on our window ("Pong") and a horizontal line down the middle like the
original game had.
</p>
<pre><code class="java">public class Pong extends BounceGameWindow{
  ...
  public Pong(){
    ...
    //set the title
    setTitle("Pong");
  }
  ...
  @Override
  public void paint(Graphics g){
    ...
    //draw the horizontal line
    g.setColor(Color.GRAY);
    g.drawLine(320,0,320,480);
  }
  ...
}</pre></code>
<div class="captioned">
<img src="../imgs/pong06.png" />
That looks like the same game to me.
</div>

<h2>Doing More</h2>
<p>Now it's up to you to make it a better game (if you feel like it). Add speed boosts to the paddles when you press
a button. Make the ball take random bad-bounces. Give the players a fixed number of "lives". Whatever you want - 
it's up to you.</p>
